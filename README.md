#SnakeGame
by SteveJ

## Known bugs

- If user presses keys too quickly snake will effectively 'reverse' and crash in to itself.
- Snake does not automatically start moving on game start
- Possible for food to appear on snake body
- If food is on overlap boundary it doesn't get eaten. Interesting to see what would happen if it loaded in a corner

## Suggestions

- Remember DRY principles
- _Always_ use meaningful variable names. Make your code as easy to read and understand as possible.
